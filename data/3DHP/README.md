# MPI-INF-3DHP

We set up the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset following [P-STMO](https://github.com/paTRICK-swk/P-STMO). However, our training/testing data is different from theirs. They train and evaluate on 3D poses scaled to the height of the universal skeleton used by Human3.6M (officially called "univ_annot3"), while we use the ground truth 3D poses (officially called "annot3"). The former does not guarantee that the reprojection (used by the proposed JPMA) of the rescaled 3D poses is consistent with the 2D inputs, while the latter does. You can download our processed data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOM_CvLr4Ngv6Cupz1H-tt1A6bQPd_yg/view?usp=share_link). Put them in the `./data/3DHP/` directory.
